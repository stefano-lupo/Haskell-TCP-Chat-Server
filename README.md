# Haskell
This branch contains all of the commits I made from initially learning Haskell, to getting a basic server up and running. I abandoned Haskell as I was running out of time and jumped over to Java to build the fully functional chat server which is available on the [master branch](https://github.com/stefano-lupo/TCP-Chat-Server/tree/master)
